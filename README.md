# cqdm

A drop-in replacement for the popular [tqdm library](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm), accelerated with C bindings.

## Usage

Replace usages of `tqdm.tqdm` with `cqdm.cqdm`. This can be done
succinctly by changing your `import` statement:

```python
# was: from tqdm import tqdm
from cqdm import cqdm as tqdm
```

## Performance

This library has about 1/3 the overhead of standard `tqdm`:

This graph was generated by running `performance.py`.

## Developing

1. Create a fresh `venv`
2. Install `tqdm` with `pip install tqdm`
3. Install `matplotlib` with `python3 -m pip install matplotlib`
4. If on linux, then it might be necessary to install a gui backend for `plt.show()` to function. Do so with `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
5. Build the C-extension with `python setup.py build`
6. Install it with `python setup.py install`
7. Run the demo with `python scratch.py`
8. Generate the performance graph with `python performance.py`

## TODO

- Look into Python bytecode (compare with/without our "hack")
- Speed up C extension
  - look into debugging/profiling C extensions
- Otherwise clean up project (combining with the base tqdm library/repo)
